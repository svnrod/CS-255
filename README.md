- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company that teaches students how to drive and provides different learning materials for driving through their online system as well as providing in-person training through instructors. The owner of DriverPass wanted an entire system that served as a learning environment where users can make an account, create a profile, access learning materials, take driving tests, watch videos, and set appointments to set up in-person driving instruction. 

- What did you do particularly well?

Out of all the work I completed, I felt that I completed the Business Requirements document well and provided a ton of feedback on what had to be done in order to finish this project successfully.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I would rework on the System Design document since I felt that I could have worked on my UML diagrams more and included a ton of more functionality to the system as a whole and the diagrams.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

It is important to consider the user's needs when designing a program because the ultimate goal of a program is to solve a problem or meet a need for the user. By considering the user's needs, you can ensure that the program is useful, easy to use, and meets the user's expectations.

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

There are many different techniques and strategies that can be used to analyze and design a system or software. Some include user-centered design which focuses more on the needs of the user and their end goal, agile development, use case analysis and prototyping along with quality assurance testing.
